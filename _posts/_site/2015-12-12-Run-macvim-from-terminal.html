<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">$ </span>brew install macvim --with-override-system-vim</code></pre></div>

<p>it will create <code>vi</code> and <code>vim</code> command under <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>
and if you want to open a file from terminal using macvim, just type ‘vi file’ or ‘vim file ‘. These two commands acted as <code>mvim -v</code>. That’s all.
